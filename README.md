# 🦀 Rust Learning Repository

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to documenting **my learning journey with Rust**. Here, you'll find notes, code snippets, experiments, and projects as I explore the Rust programming language.

## 🚀 About

This repo is a personal notebook and sandbox for:

- Practicing Rust syntax and features
- Experimenting with Rust projects, crates, and tools
- Exploring topics like ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, concurrency, and more
- Sharing what I learn with the community

## 📝 Why Rust?

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on performance, reliability, and memory safety. I'm learning Rust to:

- Build fast and reliable software
- Understand memory management and low-level programming concepts
- Expand my programming skill set

## 📂 Contents

- `src/` — Rust source files, mini-projects, and code experiments
- `notes/` — Personal notes and explanations about Rust concepts
- `Cargo.toml` — Project configuration and dependencies
